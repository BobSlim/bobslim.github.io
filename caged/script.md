I watched you

We were friends

we were together

then I let you go

# START
# Caged
By my black window, streams of consciousness ebb and flow.
All manner of creature, seeking to impress those like me.
I sit by it, listless, searching, alone.

A bird caught my eye. She sung a song that rhymed with mine.
I watched, rapt as she danced, flitting from branch to branch.
I slept, watching her. She was in my dreams, too.

Night after night, I was there, peering into the dark. Looking.
I wanted to see her again. I wanted to hear how her song ended.
Then - there she was.

This was how it was for some time. Life took on a brighter hue.
The distresses and discomforts, I could ignore. While you sung.
She got used to me.
